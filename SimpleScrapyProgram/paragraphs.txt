I derived two gifts from my time at NMAMIT - knowledge from my Professors and friendships from my classmates. 25 years on, I cherish them both.
Every year, the most outstanding and distinguished students of every branch of Engineering at NMAMIT are awarded The Sanjeeth Shetty Leaders Fellowship. As Patron of the Fellowship, I enjoy the pleasure of meeting 8 new Fellows every year. I have an enduring relationship with the Fellows - a matter of great personal satisfaction and meaning for me.
"NMAMIT has been a foundation pillar for what I am today. I am deeply thankful to my teachers  and the management for directing and shaping my  life. I have very fond memories of the time spent at the college and, at the hostel which I continue to cherish. It gives me immense pleasure to see my college achieving great heights."
NMAMIT, to me, has been a strong platform for transforming my interests and dreams into actual skills that aided in not just technical and professional growth but also in building a strong foundation to an overall personality development. One of the many fond memorable experiences for me has been the support that I and my team received by the Principal, HODs, Training & Placement team and various staff members in starting the industry-university collaboration NET- KARMIC during the final year project work, which gave us exposure to the  way of working in the competitive world outside and helped explore our interest in the field of Micro-electronics.  Words would fall short to describe the fond memories and rich experience of the four years' life at Nitte.  
From NMAMIT, I got recruited to L&T Technology Services. Gradually, I co-led a 15 member team to develop software to remotely monitor and control electrical products.Currently, I am responsible for providing technology solutions to a 36+ member team at SIEMENS  
While with L&T, my team won  excellence awards every year at the L&T’s annual award ceremony. We were successful because all of us had one vision - to work with one another to deliver quality products. I picked up this team spirit attitude very early in my engineering days at NMAMIT through Fresher' orientation programme.  We were compelled to break the ice amongst us, freshers, by participating in the team based activities. This team based approach continued in our core curriculum classes as well In addition to the impeccable teaching at NMAMIT, Abhyuday, the Placement and Student Welfare Team plays a crucial role in students; holistic development. I got an opportunity in my very first year to start a placement newsletter called RUBIK, in an attempt to help the 3rd and final year students to prepare for college placements. I was also included in organizing major events such as “TEDx”, “Microsoft Dreamspark Yatra” and concert of “Band of Boys” on campus. I strongly believe that if one has interest, opportunities are always available at NMAMIT!   
Volunteering in  NMAMIT  has  influenced me so much  that  I continue to volunteer actively with UNICEF, Grow-Trees, WWF and many more. NMAMIT has been the best chapter of my life. 
  "NMAMIT has played a pivotal role in shaping my career and I fondly remember my journey with this institution. All our faculty members were always approachable and kept us motivated. The college takes initiatives to host various technical and cultural events that keeps students usefully engaged.  
I was able to pursue the same career path that I had chosen as my branch of study and I am happy to have done my professional education here." 
My personality and career have been majorly influenced by NMAMIT.
It helps every student to discover his/her  strengths and provides opportunities to express it.  The campus housed amidst nature is beautiful, sports facilities excellent, cultural events delightful, technical clubs challenging,  and Placement opportunities,  excellent.  I am very grateful to my alma mater for being generous, kind, student-friendly and motivating. Where I work, NMAMIT is  lauded for its contribution of  ethically sound, honest and intelligent Engineers to the industry.
When I first learnt  that NMAMIT, Nitte would be the college for my Under Graduate studies,  I thought to myself that  it will be just like any other college.  Well,  at the end of 4 years I grew to comprehend that it was a life changing and unbelievable experience for me. To sum it up, in my 4 years here  I made a few really great  friends;  accomplished some unbelievable things; acquired sound practical knowledge;  confidently started an NGO; got a great job and most importantly I was a bold  graduate capable of survival in the competitive world. The kind of support that we get from the college and the placement department is unbelievable. We  were encouraged to study well and to take up extracurricular activities with passion and compassion. 
It was here that my entrepreneurial journey began. We started an NGO that was supported by the college. Then I got a good job on campus and gave my best there.  My journey continued and I started my own company which got acquired by a major international company. 
This college has shaped my life and taught me to never give up till you achieve your best.   NMAMIT is  a college where you will truly LIVE your graduate life and in the process, realise what you want to achieve in life too!
I am an alumnus of NMAMIT, Nitte and have graduated in the year 2013. I have pursued my Engineering in the Electronics and Communications stream.
The college has played a vital role in grooming me to face the challenges in the professional world. The E&CE department had several good faculty members who had selflessly devoted towards my overall wellbeing. The counselling and placements cell is where I found the light of the day. The role played by the cell in transforming me into a person I am today has been extremely vital in my life. I also happened to get placed in the first ever company that had visited the campus during my final year.
Life had different plans for me and I ended up answering my inner calling and took up a career in the Indian Armed Forces.
Presently I am serving as an Officer in the rank of Lieutenant at one of the premier Air stations of the Indian Navy. I am specialized in Atmospheric Sciences and I am carrying out Meteorological duties.
The platform provided to me by the college has provided me with that initial thrust required to be chasing my dreams.
NMAMIT encourages its students to be technically competent through its well-equipped labs, mentoring by faculty- alumni-senior students. The activities conducted by the departments in college, equip students with skills for campus placements and higher studies. NMAMIT treats senior and junior students alike as  equals and provides the same opportunities to pick,  learn and grow. Technical expertise, importance of continuous learning, team play, and the concept of 'One for all, all for one' that I learnt at Abhyuday has helped me grow and continue to grow in my professional life.
About my life in Nitte : My 4 years in Nitte has been the best time of my academic life and I cherish each and every thing about the alma mater. The amount of love, guidance and support I received from everyone in NMAMIT has been absolutely tremendous. I do not want to change my 4 years of Engineering life to anything else as they have been the foundation to my 20 years of professional career. I can go on talking about the highs of the 4 years and I would still have more to say. The environment, teachers, non-teaching staff, canteen, printing staff, stationery staff, the temple and everyone who plays a major or a minor part of the everyday life in Nitte have touched my heart and have a place in it forever. 'Priceless' and 'Precious'  are 2 words that sum my feelings for Nitte. 
NMAMIT has been a great experience and influence in my life. I was fortunate to be guided by competent and experienced professors. I enjoyed staying at the college hostel and utilized the exhaustive collection of references at the college library. I utilized the outdoor and indoor sports facilities optimally too. 
NMAMIT provided me with everything I desired. I learnt here that success is a journey, not a destination and it has consistently made this journey enchanting!!
I stay in touch with NMAMIT and visit it often and will continue to do so.
Thank you NMAMIT for the handholding to make me a confident engineer.
I give credit to my Department of Biotechnology for shaping me for the person I am today and instilling in me the entrepreneur instinct which lent a helping hand in the existence of  Vedan.  Vedan is developing and is in the process of bringing into life high quality products with the expertise instilled during my time at NMAMIT, Nitte. 
Nitte is my second home. I have built great relationships with my classmates and lecturers. Being a student of Department of Biotechnology Engineering has been an amazing experience for me that has helped me grow personally and professionally. I am forever grateful to have been lectured by such wonderful faculty in my department. This Institution is a gem to all of us.

 
I would call, biotechnology as a mixture of knowledge/art/skill/innovation filled with life, that has impactedevery aspect related to human survival on this earth. Its soon going to be ‘GOD’ of our basic needs. 
 Nitte days were some of the best days of my life. I am always grateful to my alma mater for shaping my personality and helping me realize my dreams. My department gave me an excellent opportunity to explore the field of Biotechnology and develop curiosity and scientific thinking. Kudos to our wonderful teachers for their passion and hardwork and making a positive impact on every student's life.
 Biotechnology at NMAMIT has been a turning point in my life. From starting my coursework till completing group projects, it has been a very fruitful journey. Both academic and soft skills that I had learnt on campus, had been very instrumental for me while working at Biocon and now at Qiagen BioInformatics.  I owe a debt of gratitude to my professors without whom I wouldn’t be in the place I am today
 My passion for Biotechnology and pursuing a bachelor’s in NMAMIT translated my zeal into reality. I have enjoyed every bit of my learning in the friendly ambiance cultivated by our professors. The strong conceptual knowledge gained from this multidiscipline course drove me to master environmental science. I have specialized in Air Quality Control and I have been consciously contributing towards the regulation and measurement of automotive exhaust emission.
 In a nutshell, NMAMIT destined me to be a contented and radiant person.
Pursuing my B.E. in Biotechnology at NMAMIT, Nitte, far away from my home town (more than 1500 km), was amazing and has shaped me into who I am today. The teachers not only built a platform for understanding basic concepts but also provided both core theoretical and practical knowledge, making this one of my best academic experiences. The institute, with its teachings, has helped me build a career in the research and development of diagnostic and therapeutic products. 
 NMAMIT, Nitte, my alma mater provided me with very qualified professors and academics which helped me in my personal and professional growth. I gained both the skills and confidence to thoughtfully use them in my day to day approach at work. It was my immense pleasure to be part of this prestigious institution with diverse opportunities and culture
Being trained at the state of the art facility, and being mentored by the most learnt faculties of Department of Biotechnology Engineering, NMAMIT, Nitte - I have achieved the goal that I had set for my career. NMAMIT has given me the best four years of my life and has carved me into a focused, target oriented and a better human being. I am glad that NMAMIT is my Alma Mater  
The BT family of Nitte is cherished my personal and professional life with all the values which are essential to become a good independent
						  er as well as a better personality. What I am now is due to the strong fundamental stones laid by all of you. Merci !  
 Bio-Tech department, NMAMIT is the sole reason which made me excel both academically and professionally. Not only during my academic career, the professors also helped me during my days of entrepreneur. I'm eternally indebted to the Bio-Tech department for rendering the much needed help. 
 The profound learning and training received during my graduation in Biotechnology, empowered me to deliver innovative healthcare and affordable medication to patients in various continents. It was a pleasing experience being a part of the Biotechnology department where I was able to nurture my dreams and turn them to reality. I owe my success to the motivation received from my tutors at NMAMIT. 
"College life is an important part of an individual’s life, broadening horizons, providing a broad platform to understand and prove oneself. I chose the Biotechnology Engineering program at NMAMIT and with scrupulous mentorship by  Dr.Vaman Rao, the HoD,  and  the encouragement of all my teachers, did well in academics, to be able to complete my final year project from the National University of Singapore which enhanced my  confidence.

"The zeal to attain excellence and always maintain a fast-paced, dynamic, solution-oriented mindset  and the encouragement/mentoring that is offered to any student willing to go the extra mile, are the hallmarks of the Department of Biotechnology at NMAMIT. With the guidance provided, I completed my final year project at The National University of Singapore and propelled my two-year research-based project to national  & international forums; managed a Summer Research Fellowship at  the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.This got me a taste of research and get acquainted with many eminent scholars and free-thinkers. NMAMIT empowered me to complete M.Tech in Biotechnology from IIT Guwahati and I am currently pursuing a career in research in the sector of diagnostic development for infectious diseases. I hope to do justice to this institution abiding by  its motto, 'Strive for Excellence'."
"I have cherished my learning journey immensely in NMAMIT.  It  provided me a platform to hone my managerial and technical skills.

I derived two gifts from my time at NMAMIT - knowledge from my Professors and friendships from my classmates. 25 years on, I cherish them both.
Every year, the most outstanding and distinguished students of every branch of Engineering at NMAMIT are awarded The Sanjeeth Shetty Leaders Fellowship. As Patron of the Fellowship, I enjoy the pleasure of meeting 8 new Fellows every year. I have an enduring relationship with the Fellows - a matter of great personal satisfaction and meaning for me.

I have very fond memories of the time spent at the college and, at the hostel which I continue to cherish. It gives me immense pleasure to see my college achieving great heights."
I would like to say that my engineering at NMAMIT is something that I'll always cherish. The learning experience and the exposure that it provides is commendable. Faculty are amazing and are a constant source of support and  motivation to aim higher to achieve more. Apart from the normal curriculum there are many clubs that've helped me expand my horizons, taken me through pragmatic ways of learning. Thanks to the Campus Placements, I've been placed in a core company for Mechanical Engineering.
NMAMIT offers the perfect combination of learning &self development at Nitte. The teaching and mentoring available is unparalleled. Studying under the guidance of experienced and enthusiastic faculty of ISE was the greatest honour for me. Placement record is outstanding at Nitte and this has been possible only because of the dedicated placement team. From academics to soft skills, personal development to getting placed in one of the most reputed organizations, everything is worth commending. For me, a student from a distant part of the country, the journey was exciting. I got to meet  people of various  cultural backgrounds from all parts of the country  in  Nite, a place of unique harmony. I shall always remain  grateful to NMAMIT for helping me discover myself and nurturing me to be  a better human being.
"NMAMIT is an amazing place for students to build their skills and aptitude. The teaching staff  are excellent in their fields. Students are great learners. The college not only focuses on academics but also on extra curricular activities promoting  students' growth.  Summing it up, I say, 'It was an honor for me  to be a part of NMAMIT".
I am grateful to  the faculty of NMAMIT and the Training & Placement Department who've   ensured maximum  placements for students. The institute starts grooming us for placements a few months before placements, and has a course- Professional Skills Enhancement. The practise of mock tests and interviews  by  Abhyuday&  our faculty members makes  us confident to face it and succeed. 
A teacher who shares his journey  with ‘This is what I do, and it led to these results'  can not be replaced by a text book that prescribes  basics of Technology. Information Science Department has  faculty members who  encourage  students to experiment  and understand the fundamentals. I am proud  that I graduated from NMAMIT, under the guidance of the brilliant teachers we  were fortunate to have.
“ High performance environment @ NMAMIT nurtures  individuals to explore possibilities; enhances knowledge and confidence for a  successful professional career and equally  successful life ”
My sincere gratitude to my Alma Mater. I cannot forget their contribution which helped me during the formative years and subsequently at the start of my professional career.
It was a wonderful experience at NMAMIT, Nitte. The faculty members were always encouraging and supportive. The pre-placement activities were very helpful with all the mock tests and training sessions.
I am indebted to NMAMIT for providing me excellent lecturers  in my M.Tech programme and opportunities to develop my professional personality. NMAMIT has an amazing Placement cell that invites the  best of  companies  to get their students hired for good positions. I express my deep gratitude to all my teachers of NMAMIT. I had the best facilities -a good library, labs, canteen, hostel,  indoor and outdoor sports. I shall always remain grateful to NMAMIT. 
"NMAMIT has been a great place for me to learn and grow as a student  before I started my career as an engineer.   
One always gets all the support from the faculty and the Placement department when it comes to job hunting as well as  personality development. I am glad to say during my time I was placed in 3 companies.  
Four years that  I have spent in Nitte has  been a fun ride with learning and improving myself  constatnly to be better which helped me in earning 'The Best outgoing Student' title  from my stream."  
'With 34 yrs of rich experience in the field of technical education, the NMAMIT' management and teaching staff understand the needs of the current market and have the capabilities and infrastructure to deliver the same. It is possible only when they have the right leader with the right vision.... I still remember the words Mr. N.Vinay Hegde at our oath taking ceremony in 2008,  'Be a good human being, that is the key to success' he said. I'm very proud to be a part of such a great institute which has a proven track record of successful alumni in various fields. Thank you! ' 
For me NMAMIT is  the college that built my life.
Green all ... helped me  grow  to my best. Programs like Mission Prerana helped me develop confidence. At the Robotics club, we were supported by college towards projects, participation in events and to build our own team. We travelled across cities and states  to  take part  in National level Robotics events. Meeting  people across states, knowing  their teams, projects, robots  further stimulated our minds. 
The Mechanical engineering department is filled with  enthusiastic teachers, modern teaching methods and advanced subjects. I  took up mini-projects apart from  regular projects and  participated in hackathons under their  guidance. With a caring, competent team and meticulous planning, Abhyuday, the welfare & placement department started to train us, from the first year itself,  to face interviews. Our parent department also conducted tests and mock interviews  which helped me immensely  in times of placements.
In NMAMIT, you will find students from all parts of the country and  abroad.  There are no malls nearby, KFC or Domino's, but the food that you get in the canteen or nearby hotels is what you will remember for the rest of your life. I have not just graduated from NMAMIT. I  have lived every moment there and created memories  to last a lifetime. 
"No college is perfect, every college has its +ves and - ves. Here in NMAMIT, everyone works really hard to reduce the negatives to help students to progress.  I felt good that the teachers  helped students without any bias. The college focused not only on academics, but also on the cultural and extra-curricular activities. Regarding placements, the college tries to get as many companies as possible but it’s you who need to grab the opportunity by staying ready to get into them.  NMAMIT  has really been a great experience for me as I made friends and several beneficial  experiences that helped me prepare for the next chapter of my life. "
“NMAMIT Nitte students are well rounded in both technical and soft skill aspects.  They are trained for corporate work well ahead of their Campus drive. This saves a lot of time for companies like us and gives an edge for the students of the college.The  Placement team is very supportive and efficient throughout the process and a pleasure to work with. As an alumna of NMAMIT, it was a great experience to go back to Nitte for Campus Recruitment. Familiar faces... great memories - came flooding back . ”
My 4 years in college has been absolutely wonderful at NMAMIT. I have been extremely lucky to have professors who made my academic life comfortable thereby providing me time to explore other interests, opportunities to test my skills in various arenas - from technical clubs to sports clubs, from student chapters to college fests.
NMAMIT continuosly supports students by mentoring and counselling from the time of their entry to exit. They also have strict policies against ragging and sexual harassment  to provide a safe eco space for  growth of all individuals. 
I cannot thank the Placement Department enough for the platform they provided for my career.   My experience of college life has turned me into a wholesome person, ready to face new challenges in life every day and I wholeheartedly thank each and every one at NMAMIT who have made my college life memorable.
The college has amazing Infrastructure for imparting technical knowledge and skills required for an engineering graduate. The faculty are very enthusiastic and take up a lot of initiatives in organising training sessions and seminars for students that will help them in getting a good job in today’s competitive world.  .
“Apart from the excellent academic experience, the life skills that NMAMIT imparted, has led me to where I am today.
 I gained enormously being a part of the Cultural Student' body.  Every year I’ve  seen  it only improve - we are AWED at the overall skill sets that the NMAMITians joining us as recruits  bring to the table,  and it makes me extremely proud of my Alma mater.  I cherish every moment  I spent at NMAMIT.  The  entire  journey has been very interesting and awesome.”
"Choosing NMAMIT to pursue engineering has been one of the best decisions I have made. 
 It not only helped me shape my career but also  explore myself as an individual. I shall  always be grateful to my teachers and to all the faculty of Nitte who guided us to be on the right path.  My special regards to the Placement department who helped us  get hired on campus". 
 "At NMAMIT, I have received  equal opportunities  in curricular and extra curricular activities.  The institute has an outstanding library with a plethora of books  for all disciplines of engineering. The faculty are  co-operative and  provide vital course materials and throw  light on open queries throughout the engineering journey.  Various companies visit the campus for placements. The  placement department  simultaneously provides required training and study materials to prepare every individual for interviews and to pursue their  future endeavours."
 NMAMIT has a very beautiful campus surrounded by greenery where we learn as well as make a lot of memories with our friends in the lap of nature.  There are friendly faculty members with good subject knowledge who are  supportive of our creative and academic choices.
Facilities like robotics lab and automotive labs help us stay up to date with industries. The Institution encourages internships to enhance our chances of getting a job. As technical skills alone would not be sufficient, NMAMIT arranges for soft skills training too.
  "My sincere appreciation and gratitude to all the staff of NMAMIT  and  Abhyuday, the Training & Placement Department  for their efforts in imparting quality technical education and aptitude training. I am forever grateful to them for helping me to grab the amazing opportunity that came into my life of being a part of VMware". 
NMAMIT, to me, has been a strong platform for transforming my interests and dreams into actual skills that aided in not just technical and professional growth but also in building a strong foundation to an overall personality development. One of the many fond memorable experiences for me has been the support that I and my team received by the Principal, HODs, Training & Placement team and various staff members in starting the industry-university collaboration NET- KARMIC during the final year project work, which gave us exposure to the  way of working in the competitive world outside and helped explore our interest in the field of Micro-electronics.  Words would fall short to describe the fond memories and rich experience of the four years' life at Nitte.  
 "The NMAM institute of Technology  has always provided me an opportunity to broaden my skills and  to focus on my areas of specific interests in  Academics. The friendly attitude of the professors and their willingness to readily offer a helping hand has helped me to improve technically as well as personally. I'm proud to be an NMAMITian". 
  "Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."- Malcolm X 
I am grateful to NMAMIT, Nittefor  providing me opportunities for growth. I had an amazing college  journey. “To reach the top of the ladder, one should have a great foundation” they say. NMAMIT has given me just that to improve my professional and soft skills. Students in NMAMIT have  the benefit of exposure to the challenges of modern technology. They  have opportunities to upgrade their skills with a number of events  & activities within the college and at inter collegiate levels.  NMAMIT has an amazing bunch of experienced faculty. I have benefited greatly from the friendly, supportive student-teacher interactions. Students and teachers  strive to reach higher by stretching their limits.   
The college has a very approachable Placement department, where anyone can seek help, be it academic, personal  or career related. I have benefited a lot from this. The campus placements are growing constantly with top firms visiting NMAMIT and the placement numbers steadily rising.  I would strongly recommend my friends and family to consider NMAMIT as their college of preference.
 "The Professors and teaching methodology followed in NMAMIT have inculcated a sense of curiosity and passion towards learning within me.

  "My college has played a very important role in the larger journey  of my life. It has helped me get where I am today. I will always be grateful to NMAMIT for helping me grow. I am a proud NMAMITIAN. "  
  NMAMIT, Nitte has gained immense popularity for the quality of education,  faculty and the amazing placement opportunities it offers. The college management is really good and the environment very  pleasant and green. Placement department works extra hard to get most of the students placed in reputed companies. Four years of my journey in this college was incredible and lively. Cheers!!  
 "I joined NMAMIT with  hopes of graduating with a job in  hand.  (I had been allocated a seat in a college in Bangalore but  desired to study in my native place and the best choice was NMAMIT.)  The advantage of NMAMIT over other colleges in the city is  the beauty of  nature we get to witness, the humane nature of the people, and the encouraging teachers. They are supportive  inside and outside  the classroom with academic and extra curricular activities- cultural or sports or just about anything. NMAMIT faculty are like family . They live and teach by example.  My journey of 4 years in NMAMIT was joyful and memorable. I have learnt valuable life' lessons along with the curriculum.  The brilliant minds at Abhyuday, Placement,  make my college truly the best experience one could ever have. 
"As an alumna of undergraduate studies at NMAMIT, Nitte, I feel  proud to have done my BE in Information Science here. Post BE, I chose teaching initially as a career which I did for 3.5 years; later proceeded to do my  M.Tech in Mysore, where  i joined IT during internship and continue to be an IT professional with exposure to three major industries.  
I enjoyed my  undergraduate experience  at Nitte. I  returned to NMAMIT, to take on a teaching role  for three years. Now, when I visit NMAMIT as an IT professional, I  notice the sea change in the syllabus which is up to date.  This would definitely equip the students  to be  successful engineers in the current world." 
"I'm fortunate to have found great mentors at NMAMIT who have molded me to explore beyond my horizon by encouraging me to conduct activities that were not limited to a single domain. This ability to think creatively and laterally has definitely helped me find answers during challenging situations. Furthermore, I strongly believe the NMAMIT community including the staff, alumni, and my peers have played a crucial role in my professional career." 
I am fortunate to have  graduated from NMAMIT.
It  provided me with ample opportunities  for  growth and development. I would not be wrong  when I say  that this is one of the best colleges providing quality  education while giving equal importance to sports and other  extracurricular activities. We have the best campus atmosphere in Nitte.
Well, it is often said “Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude”. NMAMIT has been that source which has fine tuned my attitude to help me reach the altitude where I stand today. From enhancing one's self confidence  to exploring the credibility, to dream bigger and proceed towards achieving the goals our educational institutions and the faculty,  play a major role.

'Ideas-Opportunities'; 'Achievements-Applauds'- my GAINS   at  NMAMIT!! 
NMAMIT has an amazing campus amidst lush greenery. 
I'm a civil engineering graduate and have a strong foundation of knowledge. I always put my best foot forward when I step into a room and feel that I belong there.
The professors  are fountains of knowledge, truly passionate about the subject. Somewhere along the line their passion spills over to the students!  
NMAMIT  boosts extra curricular activities as well. Incridea, one of the best Technical and Cultural fests is organized here, where students from various parts of the country participate.
It's also one of the safest places for girls to stay in. 
I have truly made some amazing memories and a great network being in NMAMIT. 
I gladly say that "I am a proud NMAMITian"
NMAMIT has always been my second home. It's where I discovered a part of myself, and who I wanted to become. Hearing the word  'Nitte'  makes me smile and that's the place I want to go back to, if given a chance.This is why I  try my best to help  the juniors in their academics, especially with regard to placements, because the outstanding feature of this college is the brilliant placements offered at the end of 4 years. 
The three most important factors influencing  success for an engineer  are ' Learning Environment, Branch of interest and opportunity for Placements'. NMAMIT provides all three - the ideal atmosphere for learning, best faculty (as I had in  CSE  who are also friendly and helpful) and, good  placements. 
Abhyuday, the counselling, welfare, training & placement department works efficiently with concern,  to groom all the students to prepare them for life and find  placements in the best possible companies. (Placements begin on entering the final year), I even had the rich privilege  and freedom of running  a program to  train the 3rd year students to prepare for placements along with a  team of like minded campus recruited students, a process that trains us in compassionate leadership.
“I cherish the four years I spent at NMAMIT. The experience has been nothing less than extraordinary. I say this because of the plethora of opportunities that we were presented with. Academia and personal growth went hand in hand, leading to a more wholesome development. The support and encouragement to pursue extra-curricular activities gave us the much-needed breather, which in turn meant we did better in our subjects. Cutting the long story short, NMAMIT gave us the perfect platform to excel both, personally and professionally.”
They say college days are the best phase of one’s life, and I definitely second that notion. I am grateful to have been exposed to ample opportunities from my very first year in NMAMIT. The numerous events, frequent seminars, extra-curricular activities, and yearly inter-college fest contributed as building blocks evolving me into the person I am today. Not only did I expand my knowledge spectrum in the field of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, but it also strengthened my leadership skills and confidence. Thank you for the most amazing four years NMAMIT, you’ll always have a piece of my heart.
NMAMIT has not only been key to our education but also taught us the basics in life and the way to succeed. The all round development we had in the 4 years of our course have been the basis for our strength and foundation to succeed in the competitive environment. 
It is the fundamentals that defines what you want to be as an Engineer. At NMAMIT’s mechanical  engineering course, the highly skilled professors, exceptional lab facilities and staff have made it an easy accomplishment.
I would like to say that my engineering at NMAMIT is something that I'll always cherish. The learning experience and the exposure that it provides is commendable. Faculty are amazing and are a constant source of support and  motivation to aim higher to achieve more. Apart from the normal curriculum there are many clubs that've helped me expand my horizons, taken me through pragmatic ways of learning. Thanks to the Campus Placements, I've been placed in a core company for Mechanical Engineering.
My sincere gratitude to my Alma Mater. I cannot forget their contribution which helped me during the formative years and subsequently at the start of my professional career.
For me NMAMIT is  the college that built my life.
Green all ... helped me  grow  to my best. Programs like Mission Prerana helped me develop confidence. At the Robotics club, we were supported by college towards projects, participation in events and to build our own team. We travelled across cities and states  to  take part  in National level Robotics events. Meeting  people across states, knowing  their teams, projects, robots  further stimulated our minds. 
The Mechanical engineering department is filled with  enthusiastic teachers, modern teaching methods and advanced subjects. I  took up mini-projects apart from  regular projects and  participated in hackathons under their  guidance. With a caring, competent team and meticulous planning, Abhyuday, the welfare & placement department started to train us, from the first year itself,  to face interviews. Our parent department also conducted tests and mock interviews  which helped me immensely  in times of placements.
In NMAMIT, you will find students from all parts of the country and  abroad.  There are no malls nearby, KFC or Domino's, but the food that you get in the canteen or nearby hotels is what you will remember for the rest of your life. I have not just graduated from NMAMIT. I  have lived every moment there and created memories  to last a lifetime. 
"No college is perfect, every college has its +ves and - ves. Here in NMAMIT, everyone works really hard to reduce the negatives to help students to progress.  I felt good that the teachers  helped students without any bias. The college focused not only on academics, but also on the cultural and extra-curricular activities. Regarding placements, the college tries to get as many companies as possible but it’s you who need to grab the opportunity by staying ready to get into them.  NMAMIT  has really been a great experience for me as I made friends and several beneficial  experiences that helped me prepare for the next chapter of my life. "
The college has amazing Infrastructure for imparting technical knowledge and skills required for an engineering graduate. The faculty are very enthusiastic and take up a lot of initiatives in organising training sessions and seminars for students that will help them in getting a good job in today’s competitive world.  .
“Apart from the excellent academic experience, the life skills that NMAMIT imparted, has led me to where I am today.
 I gained enormously being a part of the Cultural Student' body.  Every year I’ve  seen  it only improve - we are AWED at the overall skill sets that the NMAMITians joining us as recruits  bring to the table,  and it makes me extremely proud of my Alma mater.  I cherish every moment  I spent at NMAMIT.  The  entire  journey has been very interesting and awesome.”
 NMAMIT has a very beautiful campus surrounded by greenery where we learn as well as make a lot of memories with our friends in the lap of nature.  There are friendly faculty members with good subject knowledge who are  supportive of our creative and academic choices.
Facilities like robotics lab and automotive labs help us stay up to date with industries. The Institution encourages internships to enhance our chances of getting a job. As technical skills alone would not be sufficient, NMAMIT arranges for soft skills training too.
I had the privilege of being a part of the IS branch at Nitte, where I got to learn under the guidance of knowledgeable lecturers and immensely supportive classmates. Thank you for providing me with a creative and productive learning atmosphere.
Nitte has an amazing information science and engineering program. Not only am I immediately respected within the industry because I graduated from such a fine department, but I also have got much stronger background that is helping me be on par with rest of the engineers. I left graduated college with a good mix of theory and practical knowledge, and right away I was able to start contributing to the engineering team I was working on at Tesco HSC
"The four amazing years that I spent in NMAMIT were some of the best years of my life. All the friendships and camaraderie that were developed in those years is something I kind of miss now. Moreover, the friendly and approachable staff in IS&E Department made the engineering ride smoother. Not only during college days but even now, whenever I need some help with any paperwork, the department is very prompt in responding to queries. They also maintain a strong alumni network and keep reaching out to us periodically to check for any updates. Also, not to forget the various cultural and technical festivals that we got to host as well take part in being part of this department, that helped us develop our co-curricular skills as well."
In NMAMIT, Nitte I was fortunate to study at Information Science & Engineering department. The curriculum offered by the department is relevant to the Industry standards and current trends in the market in the IT Sector. My project at Infosys was on business intelligence, this course was taught at nmamit and hence it was very easy to work with Project.
Other than Curriculum I had an opportunity to explore Entrepreneurial venture through NAIN club at NMAMIT . During my engineering period I had received 6 lakhs grant for two business proposals. The Department Faculties and Principal helped and guided me to win many business plan competitions, including FKCCI Manthan 2015.
Studying in the ISE branch at NMAMIT was a fun-packed adventure. Whilst the classroom teaching and assignments are obvious elements at any university, the freedom to explore our learning approaches is what stood out the most. The teachers and professors were not only good at teaching but were great mentors and advisers too. In addition to learning, there was a great deal of encouragement towards sports and social activities; class trips to local places, organising branch-level workshops and tutorials, semester-wise inter-branch sports, and tech events and fests. Most important of all, I met some brilliant folks who pushed my boundaries in learning, creativity, and personal growth. At NMAMIT, I was able to form a long-lasting friendship with many, which made studying and learning a wholesome experience.
Currently working as an Applied Scientist - NLP. A research engineer in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.

From academics to soft skills, personal development to getting placed in one of the most reputed organizations, everything is worth commending. For me, a student from a distant part of the country, the journey was exciting. I got to meet  people of various  cultural backgrounds from all parts of the country  in  Nite, a place of unique harmony. I shall always remain  grateful to NMAMIT for helping me discover myself and nurturing me to be  a better human being.
I am grateful to  the faculty of NMAMIT and the Training & Placement Department who've   ensured maximum  placements for students. The institute starts grooming us for placements a few months before placements, and has a course- Professional Skills Enhancement. The practise of mock tests and interviews  by  Abhyuday&  our faculty members makes  us confident to face it and succeed. 
A teacher who shares his journey  with ‘This is what I do, and it led to these results'  can not be replaced by a text book that prescribes  basics of Technology. Information Science Department has  faculty members who  encourage  students to experiment  and understand the fundamentals. I am proud  that I graduated from NMAMIT, under the guidance of the brilliant teachers we  were fortunate to have.
"NMAMIT has been a great place for me to learn and grow as a student  before I started my career as an engineer.
